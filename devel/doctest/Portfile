description         The fastest feature-rich C++11/14/17/20 single-header \
                    testing framework for unit tests and TDD

long_description    \
    doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest both in \
    compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime compared to other \
    feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled languages such \
    as D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in the production code \
    thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean \
    interface.
